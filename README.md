# Python Tuple Practice Questions 
I solved some basic and important questions related to tuples to understand how they work and how they are different from lists.
Each question is written separately with simple code and clear variable names.
1. What is a tuple in Python? How is it different from a list?
2. How do you create an empty tuple?
3. Create a tuple with a single element and explain why `(5)` is not a tuple.
4. How do you access elements from a tuple?
5. How can you slice a tuple? Give an example.
6. Check if an element exists in a tuple.
7. Find the length of a tuple using Python built-in functions and also using a loop.
8. Can you modify a tuple after creation? Why or why not?
9. How do you concatenate two tuples?
10. How do you repeat a tuple 3 times?
11. Convert a list to a tuple.
12. Find the maximum and minimum values in a tuple (also using bubble sort).
13. Count how many times a specific value appears in a tuple.
14. Find the index of a specific element in a tuple.
15. Convert a tuple into a list, modify it, and convert it back to a tuple.
